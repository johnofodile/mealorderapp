input.js has very important infromation needed for this project
it is a component that is supposed to be reusable
********************

MealItem.js too is very valuable

in CartItems.js we also see array mapping






modal.js has the backdrop and overlay components used as modals passed via portals


The modal is used to wrap the Cart.js components



header.js and app.js is the perfect combination to understand props



send props through app.js to the component that uses the button and then to the button itself(app.js--->Header.js---->HeaderCartButton.js)

context is used to pass down data in complex applications.It is used in the store/cart-context.js file


using context, we have cart-context file, cartproviderfile and file that uses the usecontext hook
when using the usecontext hook, import the context file and usecontext hook
     
when using context, we have to use refs to attach the new functionality to different dom components


     ref is used in mealitem form component(line), and input.js component
     in the mealitem.js component we use context.



     the availablemeals.js file has the dummy meals which we created
